# Longest Common Subsequence problem
The problem is to find the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings. These subsequences do not need to be continuous, just in order.

For example, for the strings "ABCDA" and "ACBDA", we can find the following subsequences:
* with length 2: "AB", "AC, "AA", "BD", "BA", "CD", "CA", "DA",
* with length 3: "ABD", "ABA", "ACD", "ACA", "ADA", "BDA", "CDA",
* with length 4: "ABDA", "ACDA".

So the longest common subsequence length is 4.
